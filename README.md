# Power Apps code apps (early access preview) üöÄ

Power Apps aims to empower developers of all skillsets, including developers building web apps in IDEs like Visual Studio Code, to efficiently build and run business apps in a managed platform. Code apps is a new way for developers to bring Power Apps capabilities in web apps they‚Äôre building in an code first IDE. These capabilities are available during local development and when an app runs in Power Platform. Power Apps capabilities available to code apps includes out-of-box Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization, access to 1,500+ Power Platform connectors which can be called directly from JavaScript. Code apps make it so any developer with a command line can publish and host their line of business web app in Power Platform. Also, code apps respect your organization‚Äôs Managed Platform policies like app sharing limits, Conditional access policies and Data Loss Prevention. Code apps and the managed platform reinforces accelerated innovation in safe places and, when ready, these apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments. 

## What is a code app? ‚ú®

Code apps allow developers to write custom code (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that runs seamlessly within Power Platform. This gives you:

- **Full control over your UI and logic** üíª
- **Access to Power Platform data sources** üìä
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** üîê
- **Simplified deployment and ALM** üîÑ

## Prerequisites üìã
Code apps require several developer tools like Visual Studio Code, git, dotnet, node.js, and npm to be available on the command line.  

### Install the following developer tools
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Power Apps CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)

### Create a first release Power Platform environment
First release environments are intended for non-production use and they receive Power Platform updates before other environments. For code apps EAP, it's recommended that you use a first release environment. Code app capabilities will eventually be available to all environments. Code apps require dataverse to exist in the environment.  

> [!IMPORTANT] Early access preview participants must inform Microsoft of the first release environment you want code apps enabled.

#### Option 1 ‚Äì Create a first release environment using Power Platform Admin Center 
If you create an environment in the admin center, be sure to toggle ‚ÄòGet new features early‚Äô to ‚ÄòYes‚Äô. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-environment). 

#### Option 2 - Create a first release environment using command line 
If you create an environment using command line, be sure to set LocationName to ‚Äúunitedstatesfirstrelease‚Äù. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell) 

```PowerShell 
New-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -DisplayName "Code App env" -EnvironmentSku Trial -LocationName "unitedstatesfirstrelease" -ProvisionDatabase 
```
#### License end-users with Power Apps Premium 
End-users that run code apps will need a [Power Apps Premium license](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-apps/pricing). 

## Getting Started üöÄ

### 1. Clone this repository
This repository has the start of a TypeScript app that already includes the Power Platform SDK. Later in EAP we'll add guidance to that allows you to start from scratch without using this base app. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PowerAppsCodeApps.git
cd PowerAppsCodeApps
```
## 2. Authenticate PAC CLI and point to your first release environment

```bash
pac auth create --environment {environment id}
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
pac code init
```

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev | pac code run
```

### 5. Deploy to Power Apps

```bash
npm run build | pac code push
```

If successful, this command should return a Power Apps URL to run the app. 

Optionally, you can navigate to https://make.powerapps.com to see the app in the Maker Portal. You can play, share, or see details from there. 

Congratulations! You have successfully pushed your first code app! 

> [!NOTE] If you get stuck on the ‚Äúfetching your app‚Äù loading screen or see an ‚ÄúApp timed out‚Äù error screen, double check:
> 1. that you ran npm run build
> 2. there are no issues in PowerProvider.tsx

## Additional Scenarios

### 1. Connect a code app to data üîå
Code apps enable connecting to Power Platform connectors. To do this, you will create connections, add them to the app, and update the app to call them. 

Note that these steps require that you have completed the Getting Started section and already initialized the app with ‚Äúpac code init‚Äù. 

> [!IMPORTANT] For the initial release, only SQL, SharePoint, and Office 365 Users connectors are formally supported. Other connectors (e.g. SharePoint) are expected to work but are untested. Dataverse is explicitly not supported, yet.

#### Create and set up connections in Maker Portal
You will need to start by creating and configuring connections at https://make.powerapps.com and you‚Äôll need to copy connection metadata from there for use in later steps. 

> [!IMPORTANT] For the initial release, you can only configure code apps to use existing connections that have already been pre-created in the make.powerapps.com. You cannot create new connections through PAC CLI commands. Support for creating new connections will be added in a future release.

##### 1. Launch the Maker Portal Connections page.
Go to https://make.powerapps.com and navigate to the Connections page from the left-hand navigation. 

##### 2. Create an Office 365 Users connection. 

Click ‚Äú+ New connection‚Äù and select Office 365 Users. Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù. 

> [!NOTE] If you already have an Office 365 Users connection, you can use that instead of creating a new one.

##### 3. (Optional) Create a SQL connection (or a connection for another tabular data source). 

##### 4. Copy connection metadata for all created connections. 

Copy the API name and the connection ID from the URL for each connection: 

API name - Green highlighted 
Connection ID - Yellow highlighted 

 todo: add screenshot

 #### Create and set up connections
Once you have created or identified existing connections to use and copied the connection metadata from the previous step, you will now add those connections to the app. 

Adding the data sources to the app will automatically generate a strongly typed Typescript model and service file in the repo. For example, the Office 365 Users data source will produce Office365UsersModel and Office365UsersService. 

##### 1. Add a non-tabular data source (e.g. Office 365 Users) to the app. 
From a command line, run the following. Use the API name and connection ID collected from Step #2 above. 

```bash
pac code add-data-source -a <apiName> -c <connectionId>  
```

Example
```bash
pac code add-data-source -a "shared_office365users" -c "aa35d97110f747a49205461cbfcf8558"
```

##### 2. (Optional) Add a tabular data source (e.g. SQL, SharePoint) to the app. 
From a command line, run the following. Use the API name and connection ID collected from Step #2 above. 

>[!NOTE] You will additionally need to pass a table ID and dataset name, which is controlled by the schema of your tabular data source. If you don‚Äôt already have these, instructions on how to find it are below. 

```bash
pac code add-data-source -a <apiName> -c <connectionId> --t <tableId> -d <datasetName> 
```

Examples
```bash
pac code add-data-source -a "shared_sql" -c "c9a56bae5dcb43f7ac086a2fc86fd33c" -t "[dbo].[MobileDeviceInventory]" -d "paconnectivitysql0425.database.windows.net,paruntimedb"

pac code add-data-source -a "shared_sql" -c "c9a56bae5dcb43f7ac086a2fc86fd33c" -t "[dbo].[EmployeeInformation]" -d "paconnectivitysql0425.database.windows.net,paruntimedb" 
```

>[!IMPORTANT] The following steps to retrieve a dataset name and table id are a temporary workaround. We plan to add an easier mechanism to get these values.

If you don‚Äôt already have the table and dataset name, you will have to get them by running a canvas app and copying the values from the browser network inspector: 

1. Create a new canvas app in Studio.
2. Add the connection to a canvas app.
3. Bind the connection to a gallery control.
4. Publish and run the app.
5. Open your browser‚Äôs Developer Tools, go to the Network tab, and inspect requests made when the app loads. Check the ‚Äúinvoke‚Äù request, and go to its response.
6. Find an APIM request with the connection ID, dataset name, and table ID, and copy those values.

   
Example data request URL through APIM. The bolded sections are the **connection ID**, **dataset name** and **table ID**.

https[]()://0aa4969d-c8e7-e0a7-9bf8-6925c5922de3.01.common.tip1002.azure-apihub.net/apim/sharepointonline/**ad4035b2c5d6496d9ad095d2b134a5e6**/datasets/**https%253A%252F%252Fauroratstgeo.sharepoint.com%252Fsites%252FTEST_Aurora_TST**/tables/**d1709e17-387c-4f02-89b9-19a0421a841a**/items

| property      | example value                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| connection ID | ad4035b2c5d6496d9ad095d2b134a5e6                                              |

| table ID      | d1709e17-387c-4f02-89b9-19a0421a841a    |



##### 3. (Optional) Add a SQL stored procedure as a data source. 
From a command line, run the following. Use the API name and connection ID collected from Step #2 above. 

```bash
pac code add-data-source -a <apiId> -c <connectionId> -ds <dataSourceName> -sp <storedProcedureName> 
```

Example
```bash
pac code add-data-source ‚Äìa "shared_sql" -c "c9a56bae5dcb43f7ac086a2fc86fd33c" -d "paconnectivitysql0425.database.windows.net,paruntimedb" -sp "[dbo].[GetRecordById]" 
```

##### 4. (Optional) If needed, you can delete data sources after adding. 
From a command line, run the following. Use the API name and connection ID collected from Step #2 above. 

```bash
pac code delete-data-source -a <apiName> -d <dataSourceName> 
```

Example
```bash
pac code delete-data-source -a "shared_sql" -d "MobileDeviceInventory" 
```

>[!IMPORTANT] If the schema on a connection changes, there is no command to refresh the strongly typed model and service files. To do this, delete the data source and re-add it.

#### Update the app to call connections
Once connections are added, you can update the app to use the generated model and service. 

>[!NOTE] These changes can also be made via with an IDE‚Äôs agent. For instance, in Visual Studio Code you may use Github Copilot agent mode to make them for you after the data sources have been added.

##### 1. Update the app to use the non-tabular data source (e.g. Office 365 Users).
You can see the generated files under the src/Models and src/Services folders for the strongly typed connection API. 

```code
await Office365UsersService.MyProfile() 
```

```code
 const profile = (await Office365UsersService.MyProfile_V2("id,displayName,jobTitle,id,userPrincipalName")).data; 
    setUser(profile); 
    if (profile?.id || profile?.userPrincipalName) { 
      // Try both id and userPrincipalName for photo 
      let photoData = null; 
      try { 
        photoData = (await Office365UsersService.UserPhoto_V2(profile.id || profile.userPrincipalName)).data; 
      } catch { 
        // fallback to userPrincipalName if id fails 
        if (profile.userPrincipalName) { 
          photoData = (await Office365UsersService.UserPhoto_V2(profile.userPrincipalName)).data; 
        } 
      } 
      if (photoData) setPhoto(`data:image/jpeg;base64,${photoData}`); 
```
##### 2. (Optional) Update the app to use the tabular data source (e.g. SQL). 
You can see the generated files under the src/Models and src/Services folders for the strongly typed connection API. 

Example 
```code 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.create(<record>) 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.update(id, <record>) 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.delete(id) 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.get(id) 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.getall() 
```

```code 
await MobileDeviceInventoryService.update(assetId, changedFields); 
setAssets((prevAssets) => 
‚ÄØ prevAssets.map((asset) => { 
‚ÄØ ‚ÄØ if (asset.id === assetId) { 
``` 
##### 3. Run the app locally to verify changes 
```bash
npm run dev | pac code run
```

##### 4. Push the app to run on Power Apps 
```bash
npm run build | pac code push
```
