Power Apps empowers developers of all skillsets‚Äîincluding those building web apps in IDEs like Visual Studio Code‚Äîto efficiently build and run business apps on a managed platform.

**Code Apps** is a new way for developers to bring Power Apps capabilities into web apps built in a code-first IDE. These capabilities are available both during local development and when an app runs in Power Platform.

**Key features include:**

- Out-of-the-box Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization
- Access to 1,500+ Power Platform connectors, callable directly from JavaScript
- Easy publishing and hosting of line-of-business web apps in Power Platform
- Adherence to your organization‚Äôs Managed Platform policies (app sharing limits, Conditional Access, Data Loss Prevention, etc.)

The managed platform accelerates innovation in safe environments. When ready, apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments. Code Apps and the managed platform reinforce safe, rapid innovation, and, when ready, these apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments.

# What is a code app? ‚ú®

Code apps allow developers to write custom code (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that runs seamlessly within Power Platform. This gives you:

- **Full control over your UI and logic** üíª
- **Access to Power Platform data sources** üìä
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** üîê
- **Simplified deployment and ALM** üîÑ

# Prerequisites üìã

Code apps require several developer tools like Visual Studio Code, git, dotnet, node.js, and npm to be available on the command line.  

## Install the following developer tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Power Apps CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)

## Create a first release Power Platform environment

First release environments are intended for non-production use and they receive Power Platform updates before other environments. For code apps EAP, it's recommended that you use a first release environment (it is required for SQL connector). Code app capabilities will eventually be available to all environments. Code apps require dataverse to exist in the environment.  

> [!IMPORTANT] Early access preview participants must inform Microsoft of the first release environment you want code apps enabled.

### Option 1 - Create a first release environment using PAC CLI

```PowerShell
pac admin create --name 'Code Apps' --region 'unitedstatesfirstrelease' --type 'Developer'
```

### Option 2 - Create a first release environment using command line

Be sure to set LocationName to ‚Äúunitedstatesfirstrelease‚Äù. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell)

```PowerShell
New-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -DisplayName "Code App env" -EnvironmentSku Trial -LocationName "unitedstatesfirstrelease" -ProvisionDatabase 
```

## License end-users with Power Apps Premium

End-users that run code apps will need a [Power Apps Premium license](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-apps/pricing).

# Getting Started üöÄ

## 1. Clone this repository

This repository has the start of a TypeScript app that already includes the Power Platform SDK. Later in EAP we'll add guidance to that allows you to start from scratch without using this base app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/PowerAppsCodeApps.git
cd PowerAppsCodeApps\samples\HelloWorld
```

## 2. Authenticate PAC CLI and point to your first release environment

```bash
pac auth create --environment {environment id}
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
pac code init --displayName "Hello World"
```

>[!NOTE] If you observe a PAC CLI error stating the environment does not support code apps it means Microsoft didn't enable code apps for your environment. Use the documentation provided in your EAP welcome email to submit the environment to Microsoft.
> ![](./contentMedia/pac_code_error_with_enabled_environment.png)

## 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev 
```

## 5. Deploy to Power Apps

```bash
npm run build | pac code push
```

If successful, this command should return a Power Apps URL to run the app.

Optionally, you can navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com> to see the app in the Maker Portal. You can play, share, or see details from there.

Congratulations! You have successfully pushed your first code app!

> [!NOTE] If you get stuck on the ‚Äúfetching your app‚Äù loading screen or see an ‚ÄúApp timed out‚Äù error screen, double check:
>
> 1. that you ran npm run build
> 2. there are no issues in PowerProvider.tsx

# Additional Scenarios
## 1. [Create a code app from scratch](docs/how-to-create-from-scratch.md) 
The linked documentation contains a detailed walkthrough to turn a blank app created with vite into Power Apps code app. 

## 2. [Connect a code app to data](docs/how-to-connect-to-data.md) üîå
Code apps enable connecting to Power Platform connectors. To do this, you will create connections, add them to the app, and update the app to call them.

## 3. [How to connect to Azure SQL](docs/how-to-connect-to-azure-sql.md) 
The linked documentation contains a detailed walkthrough for connecting your code app to Azure SQL.

# Limitations

1. Code apps can invoke APIs outside of Power Platform connectors. Code apps do not support [Content Security Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/content-security-policy) (CSP), yet.
2. Code apps do not support [Storage Shared Access Signature (SAS) IP restriction](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/security/data-storage#advanced-security-features ), yet.
3. Code apps don‚Äôt support Power Platform Native source code integration.
4. Code apps don‚Äôt support Dataverse solutions and therefore cannot use Power Platform pipelines for deployments.
5. Code apps don‚Äôt have a Power Platform native integration with Azure Application Insights. Azure Application Insights can be added as it would be to a generic web app but it will not include information recognized in the platform layer, such as app open events (to measure success/failure)
