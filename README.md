Power Apps empowers developers of all skillsets‚Äîincluding those building web apps in IDEs like Visual Studio Code‚Äîto efficiently build and run business apps on a managed platform.

**Code Apps** is a new way for developers to bring Power Apps capabilities into web apps built in a code-first IDE. These capabilities are available both during local development and when an app runs in Power Platform.

**Key features include:**

- Out-of-the-box Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization
- Access to 1,500+ Power Platform connectors, callable directly from JavaScript
- Easy publishing and hosting of line-of-business web apps in Power Platform
- Adherence to your organization‚Äôs Managed Platform policies (app sharing limits, Conditional Access, Data Loss Prevention, etc.)

The managed platform accelerates innovation in safe environments. When ready, apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments. Code Apps and the managed platform reinforce safe, rapid innovation, and, when ready, these apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments.

# ‚ú® What are code apps? 
Power Apps aims to empower developers of all skillsets, including developers building web apps in IDEs like Visual Studio Code, to efficiently build and run business apps in a managed platform. Code apps is a new way for developers to bring Power Apps capabilities in web apps they‚Äôre building in an code first IDE. These capabilities are available during local development and when an app runs in Power Platform. Power Apps capabilities available to code apps includes out-of-box Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization, access to 1,500+ Power Platform connectors which can be called directly from JavaScript. Code apps make it so any developer with a command line can publish and host their line of business app in Power Platform. Also, code apps respect your organization‚Äôs Managed Platform policies like app sharing limits, Conditional access policies and Data Loss Prevention. Code apps and the managed platform reinforces accelerated innovation in safe places and, when ready, these apps can be deployed to dedicated production environments.

Code apps allow developers to write custom code (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that runs seamlessly within Power Platform, which gives you:
- **Full control over your UI and logic** üíª
- **Access to Power Platform data sources** üìä
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** üîê
- **Simplified deployment and ALM** üîÑ

# üìã Prerequisites 

Code apps require several developer tools like Visual Studio Code, git, dotnet, node.js, and npm to be available on the command line.  

## Install the following developer tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Power Apps CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)

## Create a first release Power Platform environment 

First release environments are intended for non-production use and they receive Power Platform updates before other environments. For code apps EAP, it's recommended that you use a first release environment (it is required for SQL connector). Code app capabilities will eventually be available to all environments. Code apps require dataverse to exist in the environment.  

> [!IMPORTANT] Early access preview participants must inform Microsoft of the first release environment you want code apps enabled.

### Option 1 - Create a first release environment using PAC CLI

```PowerShell
pac admin create --name 'Code Apps' --region 'unitedstatesfirstrelease' --type 'Developer'
```

### Option 2 - Create a first release environment using command line

Be sure to set LocationName to ‚Äúunitedstatesfirstrelease‚Äù. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-powershell)

```PowerShell
New-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -DisplayName "Code App env" -EnvironmentSku Trial -LocationName "unitedstatesfirstrelease" -ProvisionDatabase 
```

## License end-users with Power Apps Premium

End-users that run code apps will need a [Power Apps Premium license](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-apps/pricing).

# üöß Limitations 

1. Code apps can invoke APIs outside of Power Platform connectors. Code apps do not support [Content Security Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/content-security-policy) (CSP), yet.
2. Code apps do not support [Storage Shared Access Signature (SAS) IP restriction](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/security/data-storage#advanced-security-features ), yet.
3. Code apps don‚Äôt support Power Platform Native source code integration.
4. Code apps don‚Äôt support Dataverse solutions and therefore cannot use Power Platform pipelines for deployments.
5. Code apps don‚Äôt have a Power Platform native integration with Azure Application Insights. Azure Application Insights can be added as it would be to a generic web app but it will not include information recognized in the platform layer, such as app open events (to measure success/failure)
